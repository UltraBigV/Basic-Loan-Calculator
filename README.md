# Basic-Loan-Calculator

This is a baic loan calcularor concole application written in Javascript. It uses the JFrame as well as classes.

It works by taking in your name and number then asks you the amount of money you are taking out.
It then promps you with a question saying how long you wish to take to pay back the loan and calculates your monthly repayments.

This is part of my learnig journey in Javascript.
